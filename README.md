# Student Performance Analyzer

The Student Performance Analyzer is a data analytics project developed to evaluate and monitor student academic performance using data-driven techniques. The objective of this project is to analyze student marks, identify trends, and generate meaningful insights that support better academic decision-making.

# This project was developed using Python, SQL, Excel, and Power BI:
1. Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib) was used for data cleaning, preprocessing, and exploratory data analysis (EDA).
2. SQL was used to store and manage student records efficiently in a structured database.
3. Excel was used for initial data validation, formatting, and basic analysis.
4. Power BI was used to create interactive dashboards and visual reports to present performance insights clearly.

# The system calculates important performance metrics such as:
1. Subject-wise average marks
2. Overall percentage and grades
3. Pass/Fail status
4. Top and low-performing students
5. Class performance trends

Interactive dashboards and visualizations help educators quickly understand patterns and make data-driven decisions to improve student outcomes.
This project demonstrates strong skills in data cleaning, analysis, visualization, and database management using real-world datasets.
